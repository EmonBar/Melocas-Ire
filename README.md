# Melocas-Ire
Development of a platform game called Melocas' Ire with Unity Engine. Collaboration with three other members during our second semester at EPITA.  The game we created features four playable characters, each with their own unique skills and abilities. Each level is based on a different theme, which adds variety and keeps the game interesting.
